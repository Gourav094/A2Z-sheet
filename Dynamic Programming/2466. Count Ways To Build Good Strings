problem statement:
In this question we are given with low high zero and one .
we have to return all possible strings with len b/w low to high but we can use 
'0' zero time and '1' one time at a time.
e.g-->
zero-2,one-2 low-3,high-3
all string start from Either 00 or 11 and continue to append one and zero fursther upto len <= high
o/p- 0 bcoz no string possible

//Recursive

class Solution {
public:
    int solve(int low, int high, int zero, int one,int len){
        if(len > high){
            return 0;
        }
        int ans=0;
        if(len >= low){
            ans++;
        }
        int ans1 = solve(low,high,zero,one,len+zero);
        int ans2 = solve(low,high,zero,one,len+one);
        return ans+ans1+ans2;
    }
    int countGoodStrings(int low, int high, int zero, int one) {
        return solve(low,high,zero,one,0);
    }
};
