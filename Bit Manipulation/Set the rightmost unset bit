Input:             Output:
N = 6                7

Explanation:
The binary representation of 6 is 110. After setting right most bit it becomes 111 which is 7.

logic:
we need one at right 0 so take next num and find OR so that evry number will be same and that number will alwasy one
if N & N+1   is zero then print n  i.e If a number has all one then OR operation give wrong num so print n in that case.

13 - 1 1 0 1
14 - 1 1 1 0
OR - 1 1 1 1   ==> 15


code:
int setBit(int N)
    {
        // Write Your Code here
        if((N & (N+1))  == 0){
            return N;
        }
        return N | (N+1);
    }
