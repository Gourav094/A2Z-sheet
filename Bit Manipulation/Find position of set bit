We have to return the position of set bit a number that contain only one set bit .
approach:
we know ==> the number which are only divisble by 2 contain only one set bit other have set bit greater than one 
so count the position using loop
code:
int findPosition(int N) {
        // code here
        if(N == 0){
            return -1;
        }
        if((N & (N-1)) == 0){     
            int ans=0;
            while(N){
                    ans++;
                    N=N>>1;
            }
            return ans;
        }
        else return -1;
    }
