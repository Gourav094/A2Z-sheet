We have to check ith bit is set or not .
e.g -- 
we need one at ith place so that all will become zero using rest zero and ith chacter will remains same due to one called it a mask
and do and operation with mask  
n = 13 ==> 1 1 0 1
i = 2;
mask  ==>  0 1 0 0
  &   ==>  0 1 0 0    != 0 means its not set bit return false

code:
bool checkKthBit(int n, int k)
    {
        int mask = 1 << k;
        if((n & mask) != 0){
            return true;
        } 
        else return false;
    }
