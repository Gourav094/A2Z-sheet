Since we have to check how many bits are different.
Xor operator will be better to use in same and different bits case
So Xor of them and find how many bits are one using AND
BCOZ:
XOR --> same - zero
differene- one

Code
class Solution {
public:
    int hammingDistance(int x, int y) {
        int temp=x ^ y;
        int ans=0;
        while(temp){
            if(temp & 1){
                ans++;
            }
            temp=temp >> 1;
        }
        return ans;
    }
};
