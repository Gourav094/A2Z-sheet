Input: A = 10, B = 20
Output: 4
Explanation:
A  = 01010
B  = 10100
As we can see, the bits of A that need to be flipped are 0101

we need to check the count of different bit in between two to covert A to B. means use XOR operator
steps: 1. XOR A and B
2. count number of set  bits

code:
int countBitsFlip(int a, int b){
        
        // Your logic here
        int ans=0;
        int num = a ^ b;
        while(num != 0){
            if(num & 1){
                ans++;
            }
            num=num >> 1;
        }
        return ans;
    }
