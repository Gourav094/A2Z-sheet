/logic....
we have to set ith bit and rest all the bits will be same 
we can use OR operation with 1 at kth index
it will keep the ith place always one and remains same rest\

e.g -- 
8    --> 1 0 0 0  
i=2
mask --> 0 1 0 0 
OR   --> 1 1 0 0 

code:
int setKthBit(int N, int K)
    {
        // Write Your Code here
        int mask = 1 << K;
        return (N | mask);
    }
