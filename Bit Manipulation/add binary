Input: a = "11", b = "1"
Output: "100"

Start from end digit and add both digit in carry
now we need to add (carry % 2) in ans and carry will be carry /2

Approach :
- We start at the right end of each binary number, adding the digits and any carry-over value, and storing the result in a new string.
- Now we move to the next digit on the left and repeats the process until it has gone through all the digits in both binary numbers.
- If there is any carry-over value after adding all the digits, append it to the end of the new string.
- Finally, the new string is reversed and returned as the sum of the two binary numbers.

code:
string addBinary(string a, string b) {
        int carry=0;
        string ans;
        int i=a.length()-1;
        int j=b.length()-1;
        while(i >= 0 || j >= 0 || carry){
            if(i >= 0){
                carry+=a[i--]-'0';
            }
            if(j >= 0){
                carry+=b[j--]-'0';
            }

            ans+=carry % 2 + '0';
            carry=carry/2;
        }
        reverse(ans.begin(),ans.end());
        return ans;
    }
