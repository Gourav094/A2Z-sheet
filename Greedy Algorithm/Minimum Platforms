Input: n = 6 
arr[] = {0900, 0940, 0950, 1100, 1500, 1800}
dep[] = {0910, 1200, 1120, 1130, 1900, 2000}
Output: 3
Explanation:
intution:
in whole day we can departure a train if its time is less than arival time 
if arrival time is more we need one more plpatform to hold the train
fist sort the both array
now compare arrival time and depature time and increase platform count if arrival time is greater otehrwise reduce


int findPlatform(int arr[], int dep[], int n)
    {
    	// Your code here2
      //sort both arrays 
    	sort(arr,arr+n);
    	sort(dep,dep+n);
      //we have one platform in starting 
    	int ans=1,count=1;
    	int i=1,j=0;
    	
    	while(i < n && j < n){
  //if arrival time is less than departure time we need one platform to hold the train
    	    if(arr[i]<=dep[j]){
    	        i++;
    	        count++;
    	    }
//if departure time is less than we can reduce our one platform
    	    else {
    	        j++;
    	        count--;
    	    }
//return the max count of platform
    	    ans=max(ans,count);
    	}
    	return ans;
    }
