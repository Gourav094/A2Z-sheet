Problem-
N – The maximum unit of food you can buy each day.
S – Number of days you are required to survive.
M – Unit of food required each day to survive.
Find she can survive on the island or not .she cant buy food on sunday
Input: S = 10, N = 16, M = 2
Output: 2

Explanation:
Since we can buy M food and suvive for S day then total we need M*S food .
in one day we can buy N food then check for remainder 
dry run this you will get to know 
class Solution{
public:
    int minimumDays(int S, int N, int M){
        // code here
        int sun=S/7;
        int day=S-sun;
        int total=S*M;
        int ans=0;
        if(total % N == 0){
            ans=total/N;
        }
        else ans=total/N + 1;
        
        if(ans <= day){
            return ans;
        }
        else return -1;
    }
};
